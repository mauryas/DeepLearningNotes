Introduction

This repository is created while learning different deep learning methods and code snippets created while implementing those techniques. 
The codes are trained using Google Cloud Platform and there might be still scope for hyper-parameter optimizations. The dataset used is
from Kaggle's Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge because most of the algorithms have implementations which work very well with
MNIST dataset and I might not be able really practice those parameter optimization. For implementations I had a tough choice to make 
between TensorFlow and pyTorch but decided to use TF as it has larger community. But hopefully in future I would like to get my hands 
dirty with pyTorch. The implementations are not full-blown-very-deep networks but medium sized ones for best my understanding and speedy
training.
